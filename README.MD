# MIMMIS CV ADVENTURE

This is a CV I made for a javascript school assignment. It contains of various information about me in different kinds, and i tried to make different things happen on every page. It doesnt always work properly yet, but it's on its way!( Yes, mimmi sprite can appearantly fly). It has a moving mimmi, a slideshow with a few of my old projects, and contact information. It also has a fancy hamburger menu for you mobile users out there! The cat picture is supposed to be replaced by a self portrait soon!
